## Packages
(none needed)

## Notes
Copy the updated resume PDF into client/public/ as: client/public/Sangeethkumar_Resume_1770881056253.pdf and link to /Sangeethkumar_Resume_1770881056253.pdf
Use existing profile photo already present in the project assets (do not replace). If it is under client/public, reference it as /<filename>; if it is under src/assets, import it.
No backend routes are required; this is a static single-page portfolio.
Tailwind config already supports font families via CSS variables; no need for extra Tailwind font utilities.
